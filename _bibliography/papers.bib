    abstract={Spatial cognition relies on an internal map-like representation
of space provided by hippocampal place cells, which in turn
are thought to rely on grid cells as a basis. Spatial Semantic Pointers (SSP) have been introduced as a way to represent
continuous spaces and positions via the activity of a spiking
neural network. In this work, we further develop SSP representation to replicate the firing patterns of grid cells. This
adds biological realism to the SSP representation and links biological findings with a larger theoretical framework for representing concepts. Furthermore, replicating grid cell activity
with SSPs results in greater accuracy when constructing place
cells. Improved accuracy is a result of grid cells forming the optimal basis for decoding positions and place cell output. Our
results have implications for modelling spatial cognition and
more general cognitive representations over continuous variables.},

  booktitle={Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society},
  volume={44},
  number={44},
  year={2022},
    publisher={Cognitive Science Society},
    address={Toronto, ON},
    abstract={Path integration, the ability to maintain an estimate of one's location by continuously integrating self-motion cues, 
    is a vital component of the brain's navigation system. We present a spiking neural network model of path integration derived from a starting 
    assumption that the brain represents continuous variables, such as spatial coordinates, using Spatial Semantic Pointers (SSPs). 
    SSPs are a representation for encoding continuous variables as high-dimensional vectors, and can also be used to create structured, 
    hierarchical representations for neural cognitive modelling. Path integration can be performed by a recurrently-connected neural network using 
    SSP representations. Unlike past work, we show that our model can be used to continuously update variables of any dimensionality. 
    We demonstrate that symbol-like object representations can be bound to continuous SSP representations. 
    Specifically, we incorporate a simple model of working memory to remember environment maps with such symbol-like representations situated in 2D space.},
