I am pleased to announce that applications are now open for the Language and Thought topic area at the 2025 Telluride Neuromorphic Cognition Engineering Workshop. Since 1995, this annual three week summer workshop has brought together experts from neuromorphic engineering, artificial intelligence, neuroscience, cognitive science, machine learning, electrical engineering, and robotics. The workshop includes background lectures on systems and cognitive neuroscience, practical tutorials, and hands-on projects. 

**Topic Focus:** This topic area seeks proposals for using neuromorphic algorithms and hardware to improve machine learning models by addressing issues like high computational cost, hallucinations, limited continual learning, and constrained reasoning abilities. Potential projects inlcude:

<ul>
    <li>Leveraging energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware for scalable AI systems.</li>
 <li>Deploying state space models (SSMs) on neuromorphic hardware for real-time applications.</li>
<li>Using sparse autoencoders and related methods to enhance model interpretability.</li>
<li>Developing approaches for always-on continual learning and adaptation.</li>
<li>Improving reasoning in multi-agent settings, drawing on cognitive science insights for cooperative and competitive agent interaction.</li>
</ul>

**Key Dates:**
<ul>
    <li>Application Website Opens: 10 February 2025</li>
 <li>Application Website Closes: 10 March 2025</li>
<li> Notification of Acceptance: 24 March 2024</li>
</ul>

**Submission Details:** Applicants should be at the level of graduate (PhD) students or above (i.e. postdoctoral fellows, faculty, research and engineering staff, and equivalent positions in industry and national laboratories). We encourage women and minority candidates to apply.
