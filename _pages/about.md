I am a PhD candidate in computer science at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca). I am advised by Chris Eliasmith ([Computational Neuroscience Research Group](https://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca)) and Jeff Orchard ([Neurocognitive Computing Lab](https://neurocog.uwaterloo.ca)), whose labs are affiliated with the [Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience](http://ctn.uwaterloo.ca/). The focus of my thesis is modelling spatial cognition in the brain with neurosymbolic methods.

I obtained a M.Math in the computational mathematics program at the University of Waterloo, where I researched continuous optimization and was advised by [Thomas Coleman](https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/contacts/thomas-f-coleman). I obtained my B.Sc. in mathematics and physics from [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca).
